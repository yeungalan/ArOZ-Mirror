# Introduction
This simple php / js script is basically a module from ArOZ Online BETA development build.
But the good thing is, you can use it stand along without the ArOZ System, just make sure you are running on Apache instead of Node.

## How to install
1. Download the whole repo as zip
2. Unzip it to your server's web root. Make sure you are running on Apache with PHP but not Node which MagicMirror relies on.
3. Change the location.txt to your location and save the file.
4. Open the path in your web browser and it works!

## How to change the display location


## Why there are two README files
The README.txt is for ArOZ Online BETA's help indexing system. PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THAT FILE.
And the README.md is for you, and contains the instructions to install the system.
So the content of the two README file is somewhat different.
ALWAYS READ THE README.md first before README.txt :)
